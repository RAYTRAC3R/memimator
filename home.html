    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p class="maint">This website is in it's early phases right now.  Due to COPPA and the FTC targeting animation on Youtube, many are fleeing to various other sites, while a few stay behind. I'm considering making a database website for animators, especially ones who are members of the animation meme community.  The primary goal of this website is to make it easier to find the source of a meme, the name or design of a character, a certain animator's current account, etc, and to make the community more connected across various websites.  Hopefully it works!</p>
